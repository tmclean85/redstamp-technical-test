#### 4 hours detailed styling, final tidyup

Quite likely on another attempt I would be able to shave roughly 2.5 hours off of this project. Time was lost setting up dev environemnt, as well as going back to remove unneeded assets from the project directory that I'd haphazardly put in there.

Gulp was used as a taskrunner and SASS as a CSS pre-processor.
